# AI Student Companion - Design

## System Overview

This system works in a simple way....

- Students use a web or mobile app to enter their mood or share problems.
- The backend receives the data and processes it
- An AI module checks the mood and understands the emotional state
- A database stores the data safely
- An admin dashboard shows overall stress trends without showing student names

---

## How the System Works

2. The system saves the data
3. AI checks whether the student is stressed, neutral, or positive
4. Based on this, the system gives helpful suggestions
5. Every week, a summary is created from stored data
6. Admin can see general trends in the dashboard
